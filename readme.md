Runtime typecheck library.

## what's it for?

In some rare occasions you don't want or can't involve static type checking. This library is for runtime type checking. Being a runtime library allows it to be used in a more dynamic manner with a lot of polymorphic code, dynamic typing and late binding, while still have as much guarantees as you need.

* Can be used at the edge of typed code, like user or api inputs.
* Does not require additional translation step (but has [inherent overhead](#no-overhead)).
* Allows more native, dynamic JS style while still having type guarantees.

## design

* It is designed to be composable. The main api is `Contract` constructor which produces a typecheck function. This function can be used as an assert. It does nothing if check was successful and throws otherwise.
* `Wrong` objects are used as a base error object. They subtype `TypeError` themselves, so they are of a proper `Error` type. `Wrong` type has detailed info on error occurence.
* Special `check` helper can be used to apply contracts to a value with some useful default behaviors for specific Contract-like objects (default JS constructors, predicate functions and literal values).

```js
import check from 'is.t/check'
import Iterable from 'is.t/type/Iterable'

function find (sequence, predicate) {
	check.unit({ sequence }, Iterable)
	check.unit({ predicate }, Function)

	for (const item of sequence) {
		const bool = predicate(item)
		check.as('predicate return value', Boolean, bool)
		if (bool) {
			return item
		}
	}
}
```

* `Wrong` type is built in such way, so it can be pattern matched in a cascade style. You can match and handle very specific errors first, then match more generic ones. `match` & `handle` are for that, they can be used both in try-catch and promises.

```js
import check from 'is.t/check'

function sum (a, b) {
	check.unit({ a }, Number)
	check.unit({ b }, Number)

	return a + b
}

import { multiple as handle } from 'is.t/handle'

const handler = handle(
	[ { issuer: [ 'a' ] }, () => console.log('wrong a') ],
	[ { issuer: [ 'b' ] }, () => console.log('wrong b') ],
	[ 'must_be_number', () => console.log('not numbers') ],
	[ ReferenceError, () => console.log('ReferenceError') ],
	[ Error, () => console.log('any Error') ],
)

try {
	sum(1, '2')
} catch (e) {
	handler(e)
}

import attempt from 'is.t/_/attempt'

attempt(() => sum(1, '2'), handler)

new Promise(() => sum(1, '2')).catch(handler)
```

## todo

This is a sketch of mine, it still requires a lot of work to be a mature package. Use it only if you're an enthusiast. I will help with guidance and pull request assistance.

## inspiration

This field is not popular theese days, but there was a lot of them. To name my favorites is: [sanctuary-def](https://github.com/sanctuary-js/sanctuary-def), [tcomb](https://github.com/gcanti/tcomb), [shapely](https://github.com/AriaMinaei/shapely).

[A lot of others](https://github.com/StreetStrider?after=Y3Vyc29yOjMw&direction=&q=type&sort=&tab=stars&type=).

## no overhead

Runtime type checking has an inherent overhead. It is possible to eliminate overhead completely and remove typechecks in production. You'll need code eliminating engine, like Rollup and specific transform, similar to [@rollup/plugin-strip](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/plugin-strip). Prepend your typechecks with some label (like `dev`), then apply label removing transformation for prod build.

```js
// this should be tree-shaken if no usages
import check from 'is.t/check'

function sum (a, b) {
	// prepend with dev label
	dev: check.unit({ a }, Number)
	dev: check.unit({ b }, Number)

	return a + b
}
```
